# StaticSiteT1

The main site is <b>index.html</b> <br>
The site can be viewed or deployed using any static server. <br>
It is designed to be complete responsive website and specially designed for screen size 
<ul>
<li> 1920 * 1080
<li> 1366 * 786
<li> 375 * 720
</ul>
but stills doesn't breaks and works fine on most of the other devices.
It uses bootstrap for styling of some of the component which is fetched by CDN hence internet connection is recommend to view the site.

Due to the restriction that site must be static and side content cannot be altered, the sidebar component which appears only on mobile device is not added in the main website.
Yet the task was only for designing hence, the component design is precent in this repository and must be viewed seperately form the main site (on <code>/sidebar.html</code> route ).
